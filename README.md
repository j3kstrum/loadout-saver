# Loadout Saver

Easily save your character's equipment and inventory so that you can refer to them later when gearing.  Create a share code for your favorite and most useful loadouts and share them with your friends or the community.

## Features

- Add loadouts: create a custom name for your loadout and click the "Add current loadout" button. A new loadout will be added to the bottom of your loadout list. Loadouts can be removed at any time.
- Share codes: loadouts have a button to generate a share code. Click it and the code will be copied to your clipboard. Anyone can paste your share code into their loadout saver in order to load and view the same loadout.

Loadouts will autosave unless explicitly disabled.
